What is the DOM?

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a bridge between JavaScript and the browser.

It lets JavaScript interact with HTML elements (create, delete, style, respond to events).

The DOM turns an HTML document into a tree of nodes (like a family tree).

DOM Tree Structure

Everything in HTML (elements, text, comments) becomes a node in the DOM tree.

Types of nodes:

Element Node: Represents HTML tags (e.g., <div>, <button>).

Text Node: Text inside elements.

Comment Node: HTML comments (<!-- comment -->).

Document Node: The entire HTML document (accessed with document).

How Nodes Work

Each node is a JavaScript object with properties/methods.

Example methods:

querySelector() (find elements).

addEventListener() (listen for clicks, etc.).

Example properties:

innerHTML (change content).

classList (add/remove classes).

Inheritance in the DOM

Nodes inherit properties/methods from parent types:

EventTarget ➔ Node ➔ Element ➔ HTML Elements (e.g., HTMLButtonElement).

Why inheritance matters:

All elements can use addEventListener() (inherited from EventTarget).

All nodes have textContent (inherited from Node).

Example: A <button> inherits from Element (so it has classList) and Node (so it has textContent).

Key Node Types

EventTarget: Allows nodes to handle events (e.g., addEventListener()).

Node: Basic properties like parentNode, childNodes.

Element: HTML elements with innerHTML, querySelector(), etc.

HTML Elements: Specialized types (e.g., HTMLImageElement has src property).

Important Notes

document: A special node to access the whole page (e.g., document.querySelector()).

Window: Not part of the DOM, but can use addEventListener() (inherits from EventTarget).

You don’t create nodes manually—they’re made automatically from HTML.

Why This Matters

Lets you dynamically update webpages (e.g., change text, add animations).

All elements share common methods (like addEventListener()) but also have unique features (e.g., images have src).

Example:


// Change button text  
const btn = document.querySelector("button");  
btn.textContent = "Click Me!";  
Key Terms:

DOM Tree: Structure of nodes from HTML.

Inheritance: Child nodes get features from parent types.

API: Tools/functions to interact with the DOM.

1. Selecting Elements
document.documentElement: Selects the entire HTML document.

document.head / document.body: Selects the <head> or <body> directly.

querySelector(): Selects the first matching element (e.g., document.querySelector('.class')).

querySelectorAll(): Returns a NodeList of all matching elements (not live—doesn’t update if DOM changes).

getElementById(): Selects by ID (no # needed).


document.getElementById('section-1');  
getElementsByTagName(): Returns a live HTMLCollection of elements by tag name (e.g., button).


document.getElementsByTagName('button'); // Updates if DOM changes  
getElementsByClassName(): Returns a live HTMLCollection by class name (no . needed).

2. Creating Elements
document.createElement(): Creates a new element (not yet in the DOM).


const message = document.createElement('div');  
Add content/classes:


message.textContent = 'We use cookies!';  
message.classList.add('cookie-message');  
message.innerHTML = 'We use cookies! <button class="btn">OK</button>';  
3. Inserting Elements
prepend(): Inserts as the first child of an element.

append(): Inserts as the last child of an element.


header.prepend(message); // First child  
header.append(message);  // Last child  
before() / after(): Insert as a sibling (before/after an element).


header.before(message); // Before header  
header.after(message);  // After header  
cloneNode(true): Copy an element (use true to copy all child elements).


const messageCopy = message.cloneNode(true);  
4. Deleting Elements
remove(): Deletes an element directly.


message.remove();  
Old method (removeChild):


message.parentElement.removeChild(message); // Select parent first  
Key Differences
NodeList vs. HTMLCollection:

NodeList (from querySelectorAll) is static (doesn’t update).

HTMLCollection (from getElementsByTagName/ClassName) is live (updates automatically).

Example: Cookie Message
Create the element:


const message = document.createElement('div');  
message.classList.add('cookie-message');  
message.innerHTML = 'We use cookies! <button class="btn">OK</button>';  
Insert into DOM:


document.body.append(message);  
Delete on button click:


document.querySelector('.btn').addEventListener('click', () => {  
  message.remove();  
});  
Remember:

Use querySelector and querySelectorAll for most tasks.

cloneNode() to copy elements.

Live collections (HTMLCollection) update automatically; NodeLists do not.

JavaScript Event Propagation: Capturing, Target, and Bubbling Phases
Overview
Event Propagation: When an event (e.g., a click) occurs on an element, it moves through the DOM tree in three distinct phases:
Capturing Phase
Target Phase
Bubbling Phase
Phases Explained
Capturing Phase
What Happens: The event begins at the document root and travels down to the target element.
Path: Passes through all ancestor (parent) elements of the target (e.g., html → body → section → p → a for a click on an anchor <a>).
Note: Does not involve sibling elements, only direct ancestors.
Target Phase
What Happens: The event reaches the target element—the element where the event originally occurred (e.g., the clicked <a>).
Event Handling: Event listeners attached to the target can respond here.
Bubbling Phase
What Happens: The event travels back up from the target to the document root.
Path: Passes through all ancestor elements again (e.g., a → p → section → body → html).
Key Feature: As it bubbles, the event can be handled on any ancestor as if it occurred there.
Event Listeners
Default Behavior: Event listeners handle events during the target and bubbling phases.
Capturing Option: Listeners can be set to trigger during the capturing phase (e.g., using addEventListener(event, handler, true) where true enables capturing).
Syntax Example:
javascript

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
element.addEventListener('click', () => alert('Clicked!'), false); // Bubbling (default)
element.addEventListener('click', () => alert('Capturing!'), true); // Capturing
Important Details
Event Path: Only involves ancestors, not siblings.
Non-Bubbling Events: Not all events bubble (e.g., focus doesn’t, but focusin does). Some are target-only.
Propagation: A general term for the capturing and bubbling process—events "propagate" through the DOM.
Why It Matters
Powerful Patterns: During bubbling, an event can be handled on parent elements, enabling techniques like event delegation (handling events on multiple children via a single listener on a parent).
Example: A click on <a> can trigger a listener on <section>, as if the <section> was clicked.
Practical Use: Simplifies event management in complex DOM structures.
Key Takeaways
Sequence: Capturing (down) → Target (at element) → Bubbling (up).
Flexibility: Listeners can target any phase, though bubbling is default.
Efficiency: Bubbling allows centralized event handling on ancestors.
